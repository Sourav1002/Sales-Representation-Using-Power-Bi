# Sales-Representation-Using-Power-Bi

I have used Power Bi to create and visualize a report generated using the Sales data downloaded from internet randomly. 
The user can gather all kind of information from this interactive visualization.
Factors like months,type of sales, payment method are used as filters. 

Thank You
